# Color

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

A simple drawing and coloring platform. 

## Tools:

Pen: One 'pixel' colored per click
    default
    
Brush(mode): Paint canvas without clicking
    button or 'b' key to toggle
    
Fill: Paint all empty spots with selected color
    will only fill 'empty' canvas spaces
    (temporarily disabled-- fixing issue with canvas recoloring)

Erase: Erase paint from canvas
    button or 'e' key to toggle
    will work in either pen or brush mode

Rainbow: Paints randomly colored pixels
    button or 'r' key to toggle
    will work in either pen or brush mode

Undo: Undoes the previous previous paint.  
    button or 'z' key to 'undo'.
    Can rewind very far, doesn't well with clear or fill (will implement fix shortly)
    

Splatter: Randomly spray selected color on canvas  
    not currently enabled

## Creator notes
This project is really just to learn more about javascript and
css.  Learning javascript syntax and coding style, and focusing on messing with flexbox 
certainly made my brain kind of dumb when it comes to writing clean code.

I would like to refactor some of the code and certainly seperate code blocks
into different classes/multiple files. I am trying not to get 'too ahead' of the curriculum
so i don't burn all my time and energy on something that i just find interesting.
The CSS is especially messy and i welcome and tips on organizing there.
I will certainly be breaking things up into smaller chunks in the future. As it is there are
several dozen named functions.
